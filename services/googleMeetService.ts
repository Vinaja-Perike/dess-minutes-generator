Implementing a real Google Meet API integration to fetch meeting transcriptions is a multi-step process that involves setting up a Google Cloud project, handling OAuth 2.0 authentication, and using both the Google Meet and Google Drive APIs. Below is a comprehensive guide to replace your mocked fetchMeetingData function with a live implementation.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

A Google Workspace account with a plan that supports meeting recordings and transcriptions (e.g., Business Standard, Enterprise, or Education Plus).[1]

The meeting must have had recording and transcription enabled during the call.[2][3]

You must be the meeting organizer, or the transcription file must be explicitly shared with your account, as they are stored in the organizer's Google Drive.[1][3]

Step 1: Set Up Your Google Cloud Project

Create a Google Cloud Project: If you don't have one already, create a new project in the Google Cloud Console.

Enable APIs: Navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Library" and enable the following APIs for your project:

Google Meet API

Google Drive API

Configure OAuth Consent Screen: Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen". Configure it for your application. You will need to add the necessary scopes for accessing meeting and file data.

Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials: Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" and create new "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs". Choose the appropriate application type (e.g., "Web application"). Take note of your client_id and client_secret.

Step 2: Understand the Authentication Flow (OAuth 2.0)

Your application will need to get permission from users to access their meeting data. This is done through the OAuth 2.0 flow:

Redirect the user to a Google consent screen with your client_id and the required scopes.

After the user grants permission, Google will redirect back to your application with an authorization code.

Your application will exchange this code (along with your client_secret) for an access_token and a refresh_token.

The access_token is then used to make authenticated calls to the Google Meet and Google Drive APIs.

The necessary scopes for this task are:

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly: To read meeting details.[4]

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.meet.readonly: A newer, more granular scope to read and download Meet-related files from Google Drive.[5]

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly: A broader scope for reading files from Google Drive.

Step 3: Implement the Real fetchMeetingData Function

Here is a conceptual implementation of how you would fetch a meeting transcription. This example assumes you have a valid access_token from the OAuth 2.0 flow.

First, you'll need to use the Google Meet API to find the conference record and the associated transcript. The Google Meet API can be used to get meeting artifacts like recordings and transcripts.[6][7][8]

Once you have the conference record, you can get the transcript resource, which will point to a Google Drive file.[9] Then, you'll use the Google Drive API to download this file.

Here is a breakdown of the code logic:

TypeScript
download

import { gapi } from 'gapi-script';

export interface MeetingData {
    transcription: string;
    recordingUrl: string; // This will now point to the actual recording if available
}

// Helper function to initialize the Google API client
const initializeGapiClient = (accessToken: string) => {
    gapi.client.setToken({ access_token: accessToken });
};

// Function to get the conference record ID from a meeting ID
const getConferenceRecordId = async (meetingCode: string): Promise<string | null> => {
    await gapi.client.load('https://meet.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v2');

    const response = await gapi.client.meet.conferenceRecords.list({
        filter: `space.meeting_code="${meetingCode}"`
    });

    if (response.result.conferenceRecords && response.result.conferenceRecords.length > 0) {
        // Assuming the first record is the one we want
        return response.result.conferenceRecords[0].name;
    }
    return null;
};

// Function to get the transcript document ID from a conference record
const getTranscriptDocId = async (conferenceRecordId: string): Promise<string | null> => {
    const response = await gapi.client.meet.conferenceRecords.transcripts.list({
        parent: conferenceRecordId,
    });

    if (response.result.transcripts && response.result.transcripts.length > 0) {
        // The docId is part of the name, e.g., "conferenceRecords/.../transcripts/..."
        // A more direct way is to get the document resource which contains the drive document details
        const transcriptResource = await gapi.client.meet.conferenceRecords.transcripts.get({
            name: response.result.transcripts[0].name,
        });

        if (transcriptResource.result.docId) {
            return transcriptResource.result.docId;
        }
    }
    return null;
};

// Function to download the transcript from Google Drive
const downloadTranscript = async (docId: string): Promise<string> => {
    await gapi.client.load('https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/drive/v3/rest');

    const response = await gapi.client.drive.files.export({
        fileId: docId,
        mimeType: 'text/plain',
    });

    return response.body;
};

export const fetchMeetingData = async (meetingId: string, accessToken: string): Promise<MeetingData> => {
    console.log(`Fetching data for meeting ID: ${meetingId}`);

    try {
        initializeGapiClient(accessToken);

        const conferenceRecordId = await getConferenceRecordId(meetingId);
        if (!conferenceRecordId) {
            throw new Error('Conference record not found.');
        }

        const transcriptDocId = await getTranscriptDocId(conferenceRecordId);
        if (!transcriptDocId) {
            throw new Error('Transcript not found for this conference.');
        }

        const transcription = await downloadTranscript(transcriptDocId);

        // The recording URL can be constructed if you also fetch recording metadata
        // For simplicity, we'll keep the mock-style URL here for now.
        // A real implementation would fetch the recording resource similar to the transcript.
        const recordingUrl = `https://meet.google.com/rec/${meetingId}`;

        return {
            transcription,
            recordingUrl,
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching meeting data:', error);
        // It's good practice to handle errors gracefully
        return {
            transcription: 'Error fetching transcription.',
            recordingUrl: '',
        };
    }
};
Important Considerations

Error Handling: The provided code includes basic error handling. In a production environment, you would want more robust error management to handle cases like expired tokens, insufficient permissions, or meetings without transcriptions.

Asynchronous Operations: All API calls are asynchronous and should be handled with async/await or Promises.

API Quotas: Be mindful of the API usage quotas for both the Google Meet and Google Drive APIs to avoid being rate-limited.

Security: Never expose your client_secret on the client-side. The exchange of the authorization code for an access token should happen on your server.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for integrating with the Google Meet API. You will need to adapt the OAuth 2.0 flow to your specific application's architecture (e.g., using a library like react-google-login for front-end or a server-side OAuth library).
